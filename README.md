# Overview

A (very) simple React app for editting and uploading images. This app makes use of jQuery
image annotation plugin slightly modified for use here. The original plugin's
source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/djaodjin/djaodjin-annotate) - all credit to them for the HTML canvas functionality and annotation tools herein.

The point of this application was to test what I could come up with for image
annotation in a limited time using existing tech. The combo of React and
jQuery also demonstrates how these two technologies can be used in tandem.

The point was not to create an idiomatic way of doing image annotation in a web app.

_Only tested in Chrome and not deployed to prod._
